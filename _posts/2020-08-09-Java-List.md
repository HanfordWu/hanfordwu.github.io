In Java we have three kinds of list: ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, now I am going to talk about first two.

In the course data structure and algorithm, every professor will tell you ArrayList is fast storing and accessing, slow adding or deleting, LinkedList is fast adding or deleting, slow accessing.

One thing I want to argue is LinkedList is not fast in adding and deleting.

First have a look at the interfaces of List:

Regarding adding and deleting, the methods are 
- add(object), adding object to the last, a double LinkedList take O(1)
- remove(object), First we have to find object, it takes O(n)
- add(index, object), even we have index, we still have to move pointer to index, average takes n/4, but it's still O(n).
- remove(index), same as above, it's O(n)

Adding and deleting is not fast for LinkedList because we have to find the object or index first. 


For ArrayList:
- add(object), dynamic array's amortized complexity is O(1)
- remove(object), First we have to find object, it takes O(n)
- add(index, object), related to array copying, so O(n)
- remove(index), same as above, it's O(n).

So in terms of adding and deleting, ArrayList and LinkedList are the same.



About accessing(query), the methods are:

- contain(object), it's a NP-Complete problem, takes O(n) whatever ArrayList or LinkedList.
- indexOf(object), same as above.
- get(index), ArrayList takes O(1), LinkedList takes O(n) (average n/4)

We see LinkedList really **good at adding/removing elements to first or last**, but not adding/removing elements to the middle.

ArrayList is good at accessing regarding index, but not good at adding/removing to the middle and first, but in terms of adding last, it's also amortized O(1).
