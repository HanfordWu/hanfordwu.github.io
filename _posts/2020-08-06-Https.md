### 1. What is Https?
------------------------

We know Http, request head, body, response head, body, everything is plaintext, it can be changed or hijack by third party.

Https:
- Encrypt http transmission data.
- Verify the integrity of the data.
- Verify the identity of server.


### 2. How does Https achieve above goals?

Https = Http + TLS/SSL

The difference between SSL and TLS is that they support different kinds of encryption algorithm.

The idea of SSL or TLS is that on the top of transmission layer, add encryption and decryption before the data is transmitted or used by application layer:

### 3. How to do encryption and decryption?

- **Symmetric encryption**

Encryption Key determine an algorithm of encryption.

Symmetric encryption means sender A use key K to encrypt data, A tell receiver B the K, B use the same key K to decrypt the data. The relationship is 1 V 1.

Advantage of Symmetric encryption is its efficiency.

The problems of Symmetric encryption is how do we give the key from A to B? K cannot be transmitted through internet publicly.


- **Asymmetric Encryption**

For asymmetric encryption, there are two keys: private key and public key.
Data that is encrypted by public key must be decrypted by private key, vice versa. Public key can be transmitted through internet publicly. It's used for sender to encrypt, Private key only kept by receiver, it's used for decryption.

The idea of Asymmetric Encryption is that, A has something want to receive from B, A tell B the public key, B encrypt the data using public key. No one can decrypt the data because only A has the private key. So the transmission is safe.

Of course if B has something receive, it also give A its public key, and decrypt data using private key.
The relationship is 1 V N.

Asymmetric encryption looks perfectly solve the encryption problem. But there are still problems:

- Asymmetric encryption and decryption is time consuming.
- For receiver, B don't know if A is trustable, so that B can send information to A. Third party can pretend A to give B a public key, and receive information from B. That mens B don't know how to verify the identification of A.

------

- **Symmetric encryption + Asymmetric encryption**

In order to take advantage of both of them, we can combine them together.

The problem of Symmetric encryption is that A cannot pass Key to B through internet, we can make use of Asymmetric encryption to pass the key to B(The key is safe), then A and B could use Symmetric encryption to transmit data(the data is safe because only A and B know the Symmetric key).

### 4. Digital Signature

Another problem:
- The integrity of the data.

How do the receiver know the data(information or public key) is not been changed?

Solution:

- A do hash the original data, to generate a short, fixed length of code C1.
- A use key to encrypt the code.
- A encrypt original data using key.
- A transmit encrypted data and encrypted code C1 to B
- B received
- B decrypt the code and data
- B hash the decrypted data to a code C2.
- B compare C1 and C2, check whether they are the same.

The encryption key is either the key of Symmetric encryption, or the private key of Asymmetric encryption.

**How B know the public key is really from A?**
Here comes digital certification.

### 5. Digital Certificate

To solve the possible fake A, we need a trustable third party(CA) to help B.

- A submit public key, organization information, domain name to CA
- CA verify the correctness of the provided information
- CA give a certificate to A. In certificate, includes public key, information of A, expire date of certificate, sequence number, and a signature.
- The signature is, hash A's information, encrypt the hashed code by CA's private key, to get the signature.

Whenever a client starts a request to a server:
- Client(B) using `https://`, so first it will be using port 443, to get the certificate of the server.
- Client receive the certificate, certificate has the information of A
- Client hash the information to a hashed code C1
- Client decrypt the signature using CA's public key, to get the hashed code C2.
- Compare C1 and C2, if the same, then A's identification is verified.

The whole process will be:
