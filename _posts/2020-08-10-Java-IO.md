## I. Basic Concept:
-----
#### 1. Operating system and kernel

![alt](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=11w0e1DpswCsTG7_CvZaMsXqF6QhuDNq3)

**Operating System:** Managing computer hardware and software source.

**Kernel:** Heart of OS, managing process, memory, drivers, files and networks, etc.

#### 2. Kernel space and user space

In order to prevent user application operating kernel, to protect kernel, OS divides memory into two parts: Kernel-space and User-space, kernel-space is isolated.


## II. I/O
---

#### 1. Disk I/O

Principle of typical I/O operation:

![alt](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=11w0e1DpswCsTG7_CvZaMsXqF6QhuDNq3)

> DMA: Direct Memory Access, mechanism of allowing peripheral to access main memory, without CPU management all the time.

Note:
- Reading and writing are based on OS.
- Reading and writing go through user buffer, kernel buffer.

#### 2. Network I/O

The difference between Network I/O and Disk I/O is the hardware and socket.

![alt](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1pNsNA_aQ17RgyXby12z_-9lM8c3mKMoO)

Note both Network and Disk I/O are blocked pattern when reading or writing:

![alt](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1zygZ0u3Y45H8OT4kyB1VLRTNkk_oTFc8)

> recvfrom: The function of socket.

Note:
- Network I/O reading and writing go through user buffer and socket buffer.
- During recvfrom starts and the data is ready, Server's reading and writing process is blocked inside of recvfrom. After recvfrom return, user's process starts processing data.

## III. Java I/O
---

#### 1. Stream

Stream is the abstraction of data binary stream, to hide the difference of hardware and operating system.


#### 2. I/O API

##### 2.1 Four basic abstract stream classes

- InputStream
- OutputStream
- Reader
- Writer

First two focus on bytes, last two focus on char.

##### 2.2 Two kinds of concrete stream classes

- Node streams

Contain the basic functionality of reading or writing from a **specific location**.
Types of node streams include files, memory and pipes.

![alt](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1dyCL6-5qzFffErUm1JWS8R68z9Pgo0X6)

```java
FileInputStream reader = new FileInputStream(new File("file.txt"));
FileOutputStream writer = new FileOutputStream(new File("file.txt"));
```


- Filter streams (Processing stream)

Layered onto node streams, for additional functionality – altering or managing data in the stream.

Usual functionalities:
- Buffered: Providing buffering for node stream, read or write in batch. eg. BufferedInputStream, BufferedOutputStream
- Transform byte stream to char stream: eg. InputStreamReader, OutputStreamWriter.
- Transform byte stream with primary type: eg. DataInputStream, DataOutputStream.
- Transform byte stream with object: For serialization of objects, eg. ObjectInputStream, ObjectOutputStream.

Filter streams apply adapter/decorator pattern, to extend note stream.

```java
FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream("file.txt");
// 扩展提供缓冲写
BufferedOutputStream bufferedOutputStream = new BufferedOutputStream(fileOutputStream);
 // 扩展提供提供基本数据类型写
DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(bufferedOutputStream);
```

#### 3. Java NIO

##### 3.1 Problem of Standard I/O 

- Problem 1: Multiple copying

At least, we must copy data from disk/network card to kernel, then from kernel to JVM heap.

However, copying data from kernel buffer to JVM directly is unsafe, because JVM GC may change the position of buffer(it's an array). When we pass parameter like offset and length to `write(byte[], offset, length)` or `new String(byte[], offset, length)`, after the process calculate the address of desired bytes, JVM GC start working, it moves the position of buffer, then the calculated address is incorrect.

In order to solve above problem, we don't copy data to JVM heap directly, but copy buffer to outside of JVM memory to protect buffer being moved. Then copy to heap when the byte is needed.

Hence there are 6 copying for a buffered data reading in and writing out:

-  Problem 2: Blocked process result in high memory requirement and low concurrency

In Network I/O operation, connecting, reading, and sending are blocked when they are waiting for kernel buffer to be ready.

```java
// 等待连接
Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();

// 连接已建立，读取请求消息
StringBuilder req = new StringBuilder();
byte[] recvByteBuf = new byte[1024];
int len;
while ((len = socket.getInputStream().read(recvByteBuf)) != -1) {
	req.append(new String(recvByteBuf, 0, len, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
}

// 写入返回消息
socket.getOutputStream().write(("server response msg".getBytes()));
socket.shutdownOutput();
```

In above server code, each request has a connection, each connection will read, write data, all reading and writing must be blocked(even though blocking doesn't use CPU, it use memory and needs time to communicating when revoking and blocking):

![alt](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1qn2wTxvchima0m_pyZYvUPSuG0N6w7Io)

So that server hardly support many connection at the same time.

##### 3.2 Solution: Java NIO

Java NIO three core components:
- Buffer
- Channel
- Selector

Usual Buffers: ByteBuffer, CharBuffer, DoubleBuffer, FloatBuffer, IntBuffer, LongBuffer, ShortBuffer.

Take ByteBuffer as example:
Buffer support HeapByteBuffer and DirectByteBuffer

> DirectByteBuffer means the buffer memory is outside of heap, Managed by OS, not JVM, but DirectByteBuffer object is still in heap.

Benefit of DirectByteBuffer:
- Wont be collected by GC
- Can be used by methods directly, don't have to be copied to heap.
- Once DirectByteBuffer object is collected by GC, buffer(outside of JVM) memory will also be collect by a `Cleaner` inside of DirectByteBuffer.

The buffer that being outside of JVM is a normal array, has reading mode and writing mode, it has field like capacity, position, limit:

##### 3.3 Channel

Channel is corresponding Stream in standard I/O, but can be bi-direction:

The difference between a Channel and a norm Stream:
- Channel can be read or write
- Channel can be asynchronized, don't have to be blocked
- Always based on Buffer(normal stream may not use a buffer)

Most implementations of Channel in Java NIO:
- FileChannel: For file read and write
- DatagramChannel: For UDP
- SocketChannel: Used in TCP client socket to connect
- ServerSocketChannel: For TCP server socket to listening and then read or write.

In standard I/O, we get a input stream like:
`FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("test.txt");`
In NIO, we get a channel like this:
```java
FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("test.txt");
FileChannel channel = fileInputStream.channel();
```

> Note: FileChannel can only work on block mode, java.nio.channels.AsynchronousFileChannel can work on asynchronous mode.

*How to use SocketChannel?*
```java
// server socket channel:
ServerSocketChannel serverSocketChannel = ServerSocketChannel.open();
serverSocketChannel.bind(new InetSocketAddress(InetAddress.getLocalHost(), 9091));

while (true) {
	SocketChannel socketChannel = serverSocketChannel.accept();
	ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(1024);
	int readBytes = socketChannel.read(buffer);
	if (readBytes > 0) {
		// 从写数据到buffer翻转为从buffer读数据
		buffer.flip();
		byte[] bytes = new byte[buffer.remaining()];
		buffer.get(bytes);
		String body = new String(bytes, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
		System.out.println("server 收到：" + body);
	}
}
```

##### 3.4 Selector

Selector check one or more channel's status, readable or writable, so that one process can manage multiple channel, or say multiple connection.

Selector is based on multiplexing of I/O that OS provide, single process can monitor multiple connection identifier, once a connection is ready, Selector will notify user's process to read or write.

![alt](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1rO3yCa2xlc41L8jJkYC0ovGeE6F5CftL)



The steps of Selector's job:

- Initiate a Selector object
- ServerSocketChannel register socket-accept() event to the Selector
- Selector process is blocked at selector.select(), when new connection coming, process withdraw from blocked.
- Selector tell the user's channel that needs the data, then it goes back to blocked.
- The channel copy data from kernel to DirectByteBuffer
- User's channel start processing data.

![alt](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1tEpF44maz-cr8W9lawx-QlVIHO_z7ICH)


Here is the code of socket connection using NIO:
```java
Selector selector = Selector.open();
ServerSocketChannel serverSocketChannel = ServerSocketChannel.open();
serverSocketChannel.bind(new InetSocketAddress(9091));
// 配置通道为非阻塞模式
serverSocketChannel.configureBlocking(false);
// 注册服务端的socket-accept事件
serverSocketChannel.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_ACCEPT);

while (true) {
	// selector.select()会一直阻塞，直到有channel相关操作就绪
	selector.select();
	// SelectionKey关联的channel都有就绪事件
	Iterator<SelectionKey> keyIterator = selector.selectedKeys().iterator();

	while (keyIterator.hasNext()) {
		SelectionKey key = keyIterator.next();
		// 服务端socket-accept
		if (key.isAcceptable()) {
			// 获取客户端连接的channel
			SocketChannel clientSocketChannel = serverSocketChannel.accept();
			// 设置为非阻塞模式
			clientSocketChannel.configureBlocking(false);
			// 注册监听该客户端channel可读事件，并为channel关联新分配的buffer
			clientSocketChannel.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_READ, ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(1024));
		}

		// channel可读
		if (key.isReadable()) {
			SocketChannel socketChannel = (SocketChannel) key.channel();
			ByteBuffer buf = (ByteBuffer) key.attachment();

			int bytesRead;
			StringBuilder reqMsg = new StringBuilder();
			while ((bytesRead = socketChannel.read(buf)) > 0) {
				// 从buf写模式切换为读模式
				buf.flip();
				int bufRemain = buf.remaining();
				byte[] bytes = new byte[bufRemain];
				buf.get(bytes, 0, bytesRead);
				// 这里当数据包大于byteBuffer长度，有可能有粘包/拆包问题
				reqMsg.append(new String(bytes, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
				buf.clear();
			}
			System.out.println("服务端收到报文：" + reqMsg.toString());
			if (bytesRead == -1) {
				byte[] bytes = "[这是服务回的报文的报文]".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

				int length;
				for (int offset = 0; offset < bytes.length; offset += length) {
					length = Math.min(buf.capacity(), bytes.length - offset);
					buf.clear();
					buf.put(bytes, offset, length);
					buf.flip();
					socketChannel.write(buf);
				}
				socketChannel.close();
			}
		}
		// Selector不会自己从已selectedKeys中移除SelectionKey实例
		// 必须在处理完通道时自己移除 下次该channel变成就绪时，Selector会再次将其放入selectedKeys中
		keyIterator.remove();
	}
}
```
Above is complicated, unfriendly, so there are many encapsulation frame works, for example, Netty.

## IV. High Performance I/O
----
#### 1. Zero copying

Zero copying is used in I/O to reduce unnecessary CPU copying, reduce threshold occupying, improve efficiency.

Here is few implementations of zero copying:

##### 1.1 Kafka zero copying
Kafka achieve zero copying through sendfile() + DMA Gather Copy (Hardware), sending file by socket's sendfile(), only one system revocation achieve file transfer, there is no reading/writing mode switch, no copying except kernel copying.

![alt](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=100GlXnCYnb8dWAqNGUNNLCBgRw6SosHC)

The steps are following:

- User's process initiate sendfile to kernel
- Kernel use DMA copy file from disk to kernel buffer.
- Kernel copy file **description** (identifier, size) to socket buffer
- The kernel copy data to network card(NIC) using file description and DMA Gather Copy.
- User's process finish and return.

Comparing to traditional I/O, sendfile + DMA Gather Copy achieve zero copying, reducing the number of copy from 4 to 2, system revocation from 2 to 1, user process context switching from 4 to 2 DMA Copy.

Kafka is based on java.nio.FileChannel, and the `transferTo()`:

`public abstract long transferTo(long position, long count, WritableByteChannel target)
`

`transferTo()` send the file that FileChannel pointing, to one channel, whenever Consumer(connection request) consume the file, Kafka Server use FileChannel send file description to SocketChannel.


##### 1.2 RocketMQ zero copying

RocketMQ based on mmap + write to achieve zero copying: mmap() map kernel buffer address to user's buffer space(JVM heap), to achieve share data, avoiding copying data from kernel to JVM.

```java
tmp_buf = mmap(file, len); 
write(socket, tmp_buf, len);
```
![alt](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ruQI1wByhepK4COVTGYFvjZbd9-ydJiP)

The steps:
- User's process initiate `mmap()` to kernel
- `mmap()` maps kernel buffer address to user buffer address
- Kernel use DMA copy file from disk to kernel buffer
- `mmap()` return
- user process initiate write to kernel
- CPU copy data from kernel buffer to socket buffer
- Kernel DMA copy data from socket buffer to network card.
- user's write process end.

##### 1.3 Netty zero copy

There are two kinds of copying for Netty:
- Based on OS, and FileChannel's `transferTo()`
- Based on JAVA optimization, encapsulating array buffer(ByteBuffer), building a view for ByteBuffer, supporting ByteBuffer merging, splitting, keeping only one replica, reducing unnecessary copying.
