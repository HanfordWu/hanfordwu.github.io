Graph Traversal Algorithms:

- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breath-First Search (BFS)

### DFS

The idea of DFS:

- In order to be able to visit all the nodes (intersections) and come back out, fix one end of the rolled thread/robe to the entrance, and unroll the robe as you move
- Every time you visit a node for the first time, mark it with the paint 
- If you come to a unpainted node, paint it, then go further to its (or one of its) next node(s), unroll the robe along the way as always
- If you come to a previously visited node, immediately go back to where you came from (also roll back the robe along that way back)
- If the node you are back to has other possible paths, explore each of them in a similar way
- If all the paths have already been explored then go back the previous node to that node (the one you originally came from)
- Repeat the operations along the way/ Notice that each node can either be visited or unvisited, and each node can either have all its further paths explored or some of its paths are not yet explored.
- Rolling back all the way to the node you start from (the entrance), concludes successful termination of the traversal.

The problems that can be solved by DFS:

- Visit all the vertices and edges of G
- Determine whether G is connected 
  - start DFS and count reachable vertices then compare with total number of vertices in the graph
- Compute spanning tree of G if G is connected
- Compute the spanning forest of G (all spanning trees) if G is a non-connected graph. Apply DFS starting from every vertex.
- Compute the connected components of G
  - Label each vertex with a connected component # then return the total number found
- Find a path between any two given vertices, if exists. 
- Find a cycle of G, or report that G has no cycles

**DFS Analysis:**

- DFS algorithm is called exactly once for every vertex
- Each edge is examined exactly twice (once from each of its two ends)
- Consequently, DFS on a graph with n vertices and m edges is $O(n+2m)$

It should be noted however that such analysis is assuming the existence of mechanisms, that can run in constant time, to:
- Determine whether or not a vertex has been previously visited
- Mark a vertex as “unexplored” or “visited” as appropriate
- Determine whether or not an edge has been explored
- Mark edges as “unexplored” , “discovery” or “back” as appropriate
  - Notice that the labeling of a vertex or an edge is conducted exactly twice (Each vertex is labeled twice: once as UNEXPLORED once as VISITED. Each edge is labeled twice: once as UNEXPLORED and once as DISCOVERY or BACK
- Mechanisms to find incidentEdges() and opposite()

These additional mechanisms will require additional space and may affect the running time of DFS.

Fortunately, such mechanisms can be designed:
- For instance, if the graph is represented by a adjacency list data structure then incidentEdges() of a vertex v can be achieved in O(deg(v)) and opposite() can be achieved in O(1)
- Marking and testing vertices and edges can also be done in constant time by adding further attributes to these objects (this is possibly not best) or using concepts such as the decorator pattern to add further (temporary/scratch) attributes to existing objects.

Consequently, DFS can indeed achieve a running time of O(n+m), which is pretty efficient.


##### Path Finding

- We can specialize the DFS algorithm to find a path between two given vertices u and z using the template method pattern

- We call DFS(G, u) with u as the start vertex

- We use a stack S to keep track of the path between the start vertex and the current vertex

- As soon as destination vertex z is encountered, we return the path as the contents of the stack

Pseudo Code:
```
Algorithm pathDFS(G, v, z)
  setLabel(v, VISITED)
  S.push(v)
  if  v == z
    return S.elements()
  for all  e in G.incidentEdges(v)
    if  getLabel(e) == UNEXPLORED
      w = opposite(v,e)
      if getLabel(w) == UNEXPLORED
        setLabel(e, DISCOVERY)
        S.push(e)
        pathDFS(G, w, z)
        S.pop(e)
      else
        setLabel(e, BACK)
  S.pop(v)
```

##### Cycle Finding

- We can specialize the DFS algorithm to find a simple cycle using the template method pattern

- We use a stack S to keep track of the path between the start vertex and the current vertex

- As soon as a back edge (v, w) is encountered, we return the cycle as the portion of the stack from the top to vertex w.

```
Algorithm cycleDFS(G, v, z)
  setLabel(v, VISITED)
  S.push(v)
  for all  e in G.incidentEdges(v)
    if  getLabel(e) is UNEXPLORED
      w = opposite(v,e)
      S.push(e)
      if getLabel(w) is UNEXPLORED
        setLabel(e, DISCOVERY)
        cycleDFS(G, w, z)
        S.pop(e)
      else
        T = new empty stack
        repeat
            o = S.pop()
            T.push(o)
        until o = w
        return T.elements()
  S.pop(v)
```

### BFS

BFS is less adventurous than DFS, in the sense that it does not travel far, at any point of time, from where it starts 

The idea is similar to travelling between cities. First go and visit all the cities that are closest to you. If this goes fine, think about travelling to cities that are further. If this goes fine, go and travel to the ones that are even further! By the time you are adventurous, there are no more cities to visit!
 
Consequently, BFS subdivides the vertices into levels and goes “as if” in rounds to visit the vertices. 

**BFS performs as follows:**

- Start at some vertex s, which is considered as level 0. This vertex is also referred to as the “anchor” (All following explorations will be based on a distance from that anchor)

- Unroll the robe with length equivalent to the length of one edge. Go to all the vertices that you can reach with that length. These vertices belong to level 1. Paint the vertices that you visit (to mark them as VISTED)

- Once all the vertices in level 1 are visited, unroll the robe further to twice the length of an edge. Similarly go and visit all the vertices that you can reach with that length.  These vertices form level 2. If the exploration through an edge leads to an already visited vertex, mark that edge as “cross”; otherwise mark it as “discovery”

- Repeat the above operation, visiting further levels, until no more vertices are there to visit.

Pseudo code:

```
Algorithm BFS(G, s)
  Level_0 = new empty sequence
  Level_0.addLast(s)
  setLabel(s, VISITED)
  i = 0 
  while  not Li.isEmpty()
    L_i+1 = new empty sequence 
    for all  v in Li.elements() 
      for all  e in G.incidentEdges(v) 
        if  getLabel(e) is UNEXPLORED
          w = opposite(v,e)
          if  getLabel(w) is UNEXPLORED
            setLabel(e, DISCOVERY)
            setLabel(w, VISITED)
            L_i+1.addLast(w)
          else
            setLabel(e, CROSS)
    i = i + 1
```

#### BFS Analysis

- Discovery edges form a spanning tree, which is referred to as BFS tree

- Edges to already visited vertices are called “cross” edges and not “back” edges since these edges do not connect vertices to their ancestors. In fact all of these (non-tree) edges neither connect a vertex to its ancestor, nor to its descendant on the BFS tree

- We never go back to the anchor; instead we always start from the nodes of $level_i$ to go to $level_{i+1}$

**Using a BFS traversal over a graph G, it is possible to solve the following problems:**
(note: that is actually done using algorithms and subroutines that are slightly different than the above simplified shown algorithm)

- Visit all the vertices and edges of G
- Determine whether G is connected
- Compute spanning tree of G is G is connected
- Compute the spanning forest of G (all spanning trees) if G is a non-connected graph
- Compute the connected components of G
- Find a cycle of G, or report that G has no cycles
- Given a start vertex s of G, compute for every vertex v of G, a path with the minimum number of edges between s and v, or report that no such path exists

**Efficiency:**

BFS on a graph with n vertices and m edges takes 
O(n + m ) time since:
- Setting/getting a vertex/edge label takes O(1) time
- Each vertex is labeled twice 
  - once as UNEXPLORED
  - once as VISITED

- Each edge is labeled twice
  - once as UNEXPLORED
  - once as DISCOVERY or CROSS

- Each vertex is inserted once into a sequence Li 
- Method incidentEdges() is called once for each vertex

BFS runs in O(n + m) time provided the graph is represented by the adjacency list structure


### DFS vs. BFS

**Biconnected components:**

An articulation vertex  (or cut vertex) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components. A graph is biconnected  if it has no articulation vertices. Articulation points are important for networks since they represent single point of failure.

![alt](https://i.imgur.com/gq8UiRa.png)
Above graph has three biconnected parts:
{B, C, G},
{C, F, D}, and 
{A, G}
C & G are articulation point.

DFS can be used to find the articulation points in a graph and compute its disconnected components in O(n + m) time. See [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconnected_component)

Pseudo code:
```
GetArticulationPoints(i, d)
    visited[i] := true
    depth[i] := d
    low[i] := d
    childCount := 0
    isArticulation := false

    for each ni in adj[i] do
        if not visited[ni] then
            parent[ni] := i
            GetArticulationPoints(ni, d + 1)
            childCount := childCount + 1
            if low[ni] ≥ depth[i] then
                isArticulation := true
            low[i] := Min (low[i], low[ni])
        else if ni ≠ parent[i] then
            low[i] := Min (low[i], depth[ni])
    if (parent[i] ≠ null and isArticulation) or (parent[i] = null and childCount > 1) then
        Output i as articulation point
```
