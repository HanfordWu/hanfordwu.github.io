Today I just complete the online course about [AWS solution architect on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/), I've got many things to think about more.

To be honest, I didn't pay much attention on cloud services. I tried EC2 to deploy a web application, I felt it's easy to have a public IP, and that's it. But now I know cloud is going to change the way of IT.

There are many names out there. 175 services in total. Basically all the services that you can think of, aws can gives you. It is really like a ware house in ready, you can design and implement all you need to build your application.

The services are encapsulation of IT, providing API to your application. You can even not having a server instance, so called serverless services, because aws has encapsulated functionalities on the top of server. The final thing you do is paying money. It's not cheap, but it's cheaper than yourself buying, building, maintaining a warehouse.

Just like all IT stuff, aws builds a cloud based on CPU, storage and network. Their advantage is they do it in a huge scale, to reduce the average cost. Then everyone is able to benefit from its scale.

AWS is also trying to create typical use cases to speed up the design and implementation, which satisfy most of the application. But we can customize our design as well.

I think learning AWS is more about the fundamentals of computer engineering, network and store. It's a test of my knowledge, good to me know all the stuff that I should know.
