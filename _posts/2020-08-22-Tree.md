There are few misconception when to translate tree's English name to Chinese name. Here is a clarification:

| English Name                          | Chinese Name | Property                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Full Binary Tree | 真二叉树     | Children will be only 0 or 2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Perfect Binary Tree                   | 满二叉树     | - A Full Binary Tree - All leaves located at last layer. <br/>  - It has 2^(n-1)-1 nodes, where n is the height.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Complete Binary Tree                  | 完全二叉树   | - Without the last layer, it's a perfect binary tree. <br/>- Last layer nodes are aligned to left. <br/>- It can be efficiently implemented as an array, where a node at index i has children at indexes 2i and 2i+1  and a parent at index i/2, with 1-based indexing. If child index is greater than the number of nodes,  the child does not exist. |
| Heap                                  | 堆           | A complete binary tree that all parents are greater/smaller() or equal to their children.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Binary Search Tree                    | 二叉查找树   | - A binary tree <br/>- Parent is greater or equal to left child, smaller or equal to right child.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| AVL Tree                              | AVL 树       | - Balanced BST <br/>- The height difference of two children is no more than 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Red–black tree                        | 红黑树       | - Balanced <br/>- Binary Search Tree <br/>- There is one bit represents its color. A node is either black or red. <br/>- Root is black <br/>- Children of red node are black. <br/>- All leaves are "Nil"(null in java). <br/>- From every nodes to every leaf, will go through same number of black nodes.(black depth)                                                   |
| B Tree                                | B 树         | - Balanced <br/>- A search tree, but not binary tree. <br/>- Each node has limited number of elements. <br/>- Each node has ordered multiple elements and pointer pointing to one child. When searching, we can find the element or the pointer. <br/>- All leaves are at last layer.                                                                            |
| B+ Tree                               | B+ 树        | Similar to B Tree but: <br/>- The number of pointer is equal to the number of elements. <br/>- There is a link between leaves. <br/>- Inner nodes are just key, for index. <br/>- The leaves have all elements' value, so all the hits happen at leaf node.                                                                                                                                             |
| B* Tree                               | B* 树        | Variant of B+ Tree. But less node split, so higher space efficiency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
